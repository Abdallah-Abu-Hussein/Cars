				When German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886, it is considered the birth year of the modern car. In the early twentieth century, automobiles became widely available. The 1908 Model T, an American car built by the Ford Motor Company, was one of the first cars available to the general public.

  <h4> How did the first cars work?</h4>
  <p>A steam locomotive used fuel to heat water in a boiler. Steam was created as a result of this process, which expanded and pressed pistons, which turned a crankshaft. A battery powered a small electric motor that rotated a drive shaft in an electric automobile. The fuel in a gasoline automobile ignited, causing a minor explosion inside each cylinder. This explosion propelled the piston forward and rotated a crankshaft that was chained to the wheels.</p>
